# pong-neural-network
This Project Featured the creation of a Pong Game from Scratch using Python's Turtle Module

Paired with it is a trained Neural Network API that can pass out values

These values determine the desired position of the player's paddle based on the position of the ball

This experiment was to attempt to test the legitimacy of the Neural Network Model in AI Prediction during Games

## Possible Improvement
Integrate AI movement into paddle based on values returned by API.
Simulates player up against an AI
